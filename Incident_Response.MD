# Field: Incident Response

## Formal Definition

An organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyber attack. 

## Informal Definition

Collecting and examining data from an impacted system or systems in order to assist in the identification of root causes, helps determine the scope and scale of the incident, and informs the creation of courses of action that will support remediation and the generation of lessons learned.

## Utility

As computer technology becomes more pervasive in our lives, and network connectivity ubiquitous, the need to be able to identify and respond to issues both malicious and unintentional becomes more important. The more complex the organization, the more complicated the incident response is likely to be. The ability to effectively respond to incidents in a fashion that does not cause further disruption, while at the same time rapidly addresses the problems at hand, is only going to grow.

Individuals with incident response skills are in high demand in both commercial and governmental organizations. Both general business consulting firms as well as specialty incident response firms need skilled  practitioners. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not list "incident response" as an occupation, but the median annual pay for positions that could involve incident response skills are noted below:

- [Forensic Science Technician](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/forensic-science-technicians.htm): $57,850
- [Information Security Analyst](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm): $95,510
