# Field: Vulnerability Research

## Formal Definition

The identification of vulnerable conditions in software, hardware, or a system that if exploited, could lead to the compromise of the security of the software/device/system or the integrity or veracity of the data produced by the software/device/system.

## Informal Definition

Finding bugs in code or hardware that may or may not be exploitable to negative effect.

## Utility

As computer technology becomes more pervasive in our lives, and network connectivity ubiquitious, the ability to find vulnerable conditions in information technology in all its forms (software and hardware) is an important skill that can have a direct impact on not only security but safety on both an individual, enterprise, and community-wide basis.

Individuals with vulnerability research skills are in high demand in industry and the government. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not list "vulnerability research" as an occupation, but the median annual pay for positions that could involve such skills are noted below:
