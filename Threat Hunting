Field: Threat Hunting

Formal Definition

The process of proactively and iteratively searching through computer systems to detect and isolate threats that evade security solutions.

Informal Definition

Searching through system data to identify artifacts and other evidence that indicates an intrusion.

Utility

The pervasiveness of computer technology in our lives, combined with ubiquitous connectivity, means an even greater number of devices and systems that may serve as an attack vector for both organizations and individuals. Defensive mechanisms (products, aaS) address a great many security issues, but the dynamic nature of the threat means that no product will ever be 100% up-to-date. 

Threat hunting takes the principles of defense and manifests them in practical ways to augment static protections. Individuals who understand threat hunting principles are in high demand in both enterprise security teams as well as security service providers.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not list "computer forensics" as an occupation, but the median annual pay for positions that could involve computer forensics tools and skills are noted below:
