# Field: Incident Response

## Formal Definition

The tools and methods used to protect enterprise computing resources from threats originating from or via a terminal (end) device (e.g. PC, laptop, tablet, etc.).

## Informal Definition


## Utility

Threats to computer systems generally require at least one of two resources: CPU cycles, or network bandwidth (sometimes both). Endpoint protection or endpoint detection and response (EDR) is about the steps you can take to harden endpoints against threats, eliminating or reducing the risk they pose to corporate resources.
