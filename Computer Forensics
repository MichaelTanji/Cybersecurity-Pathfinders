# Field: Computer Forensics

## Formal Definition

The preservation, identification, extraction, documentation, and interpretation of computer data from computers and digital storage media. (Kruse, Heiser)

## Informal Definition

Collecting and examining digital data in order to identify artifacts or other evidence that supports or refutes a civil or criminal complaint, investigative theory, or to support diagnostic or problem-solving efforts. Data can be obtained from traditional computer, mobile phones, game consoles, automobiles, smart devices; anything that has a CPU, memory, and a network interface.

## Utility

As computer technology becomes more pervasive in our lives, and network connectivity ubiquitous, the need to be able to investigate - from both in a law enforcmenet context as well as for more benign purposes like troubleshooting - suspicious, malicious, or simply anomalous activity will become essential. The skills required to investigate crimes will require a workforce with much more technical skill, and a far better understanding of how both consumer and industrial technology works in order to address a range of criminal and civil issues.

Individuals with computer forensics skills are in high demand in law enforcement organizations at the city, state, and federal level. Both general business consulting firms as well as specialty computer forensics and security firms need skilled forensics practitioners. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not list "computer forensics" as an occupation, but the median annual pay for positions that could involve computer forensics tools and skills are noted below:

- [Forensic Science Technician](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/forensic-science-technicians.htm): $57,850
- [Information Security Analyst](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm): $95,510
- [Private Detectives and Investigators](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/protective-service/private-detectives-and-investigators.htm): $50,700

*Some states require computer forensics practitioners to hold private investigator licenses in order to perform any sort of forensics work in the state. Most forensics practitioners refute the need for such licensure, especially for elements of the job (e.g. making forensic images) that are not 'investigative' in nature.*
