# Field: Cryptography

## Formal Definition

The practice and study of techniques for securing communications against third-party compromise.

## Informal Definition

Making and using codes or other ways of obscuring a message to prevent anyone but the intended recipient from being able to read said message.

## Utility

The requirement to encode and decode messages, protecting them from adversaries of various sorts, has existed for centuries. One story on the history of cryptography has messengers shaving their heads, having messages inked on their pates, and then sent out once their hair had grown back, obscuring the text. It makes more sense when you remember that at that point in time things moved a lot slower. Modern cryptography is generally focused on math-based approaches or algorithms, given the prevelence if not outright dominance of the use of computers and information technology to communicate. 

Individuals with cryptographic skills are in high demand in the military and intelligence agencies, as well as commercial concerns that have a requirement to communicate securely both internally to business units and externally to partners or customers. The ability to detect the use of cryptography and apply basic "cracking" approaches is a skill required at state and local levels in conjunction with computer forensics work.

### Government

The most common path to learning and practicing cryptography in the government is via the military. Each service has their own cryptographic MOSes/AFSCs. The parent organization for all such training is the National Security Agency, which also runs its own training programs for civilians hired into the agency to work on cryptographic issues.

### Academic

Formal degrees are almost exclusively "cybersecurity" or "computer security" degrees, which include coursework in cryptography. A degree in mathematics is another path to working in cryptography, as math is essentially the basis for modern cryptographic practice and technique.
